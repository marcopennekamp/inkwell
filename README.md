# Inkwell

Inkwell is a highly customisable code generator, which generates Scala case classes from a database schema. It is built for and tested with [Quill](https://github.com/getquill/quill), but can be potentially used in other cases.

The name Inkwell is a play on Quill. To write with a quill, you first need to dip it in ink. An inkwell is a quick and easy method of inking your quill *consistently*. Inkwell provides consistently up-to-date "ink" for Quill by generating all the classes you need to get started with your queries.

What makes Inkwell special? Check this out:

- **It's customisable:** Generate exactly the code you need. Inkwell is *highly* customisable. You can adjust *every* aspect of schema code generation with varying degrees of ease.   
- **It's easy to use:** Inkwell provides opinionated default implementations to help you get started quickly. You can pick and choose exactly the components you need or write your own. It's very easy to extend Inkwell's default implementations.
- **It's well documented:** I know how frustrating bad documentation (or none at all!) can be, so I took my time to carefully document everything important. Just check out the source code! Is anything unclear? Go raise an issue!
- **It's open for more:** I'd love to enrich Inkwell even more with your feedback, so get issue tracking!
